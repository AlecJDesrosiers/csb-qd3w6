He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by looking out for each member of the group.

He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy Davis. Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were especially popular amongst children. His arrival in the original Toy Story created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff Woody, though this rivalry would eventually blossom into a lifelong friendship.

### Forky

Played by [Tony Hale](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355024/)

An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he doesn’t belong in Bonnie's room. Unfortunately, every time he tries to get away, Woody yanks him back into an adventure he’d rather skip. Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable spork, so he’s facing a crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose as a spork, but now has a new toy purpose thrust upon him.”

### Bo Peep

Played by [Annie Potts](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001633/)

Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody, providing a calm and loving comfort whenever he is overwhelmed. She is noted for using her shepherdess crook to hook her cowboy and bring him closer in a romantic way. In private, she is a great deal more daring with her words and actions, which Woody seems to be quite fond of. She and her sheep were bought along with the lamp not too long after Molly was born, due to the baby being scared of the dark, which "broke every toy's heart", according to Woody. The lamp comforted Molly and she would often have her hand lay on Bo's feet.
